It's time for you to show us what you've learned in the last few months on the 2 main points below:

## I. Develop the front-end part of a web or mobile web application:

Model an application;

Build a static and adaptable web user interface;

Develop a dynamic web user interface;

## II. Develop the back-end part of a web or mobile web application:

Create a database;

Develop data access components;

Develop the back-end part of a Web or Web Mobile application;

Develop and implementing components in a content management application.



###### To do this, you have several options:

## 🐅 Wild and free!

Feel free to work on your personal subject **BUT**! Before designing anything **ask your instructor** if your subject is compliant with our expectations.

Once you have submitted your project, and it has been validated, then you can start to think and design your project et go to the next step below.

## 📒 My Portfolio

As a future talented and sought-after Web Developer, you all have to pass a lot of technical interviews, so a personal portfolio website will be useful for your life after Wild Code School.

As it's your personal website, feel free to use the design you want and template it as you wish. You can find below some examples of feature

* An administration dashboard to add/edit entries in your portfolio
* Each project in your portfolio car contains a gallery, a link to the application, a description, a date...
* Manage a list of technologies/languages linked to each project
* A list of your clients
* Awesome ideas from your imagination, you are your own product owner!

## Tech challenge

Some time ago, in order to become a Wilder, we asked you to create a simple static web page. At that time, you only knew some HTML, CSS and maybe a little bit of Javascript.

It feels like a long time ago, doesn't it? It was only a few months ago!
You've since learned to develop professional websites with multiple dynamic features. Look how far you've come!

So, let's rebuild the new website for the king with all these new skills that you've acquired!

You are free to design this experience as you wish, and here are some ideas to inspire you. Please note that these are only examples, not required features. So let your imagination run wild!

* an administration dashboard to add/edit royal assets
* a gallery of your fellow Wilders portrayed as the royal family
* A ticket booking system to visit the castle
* awesome ideas from your imagination, you are your own product owner!




> Be careful though, you're limited in time so be sure to plan accordingly. You must provide something functional by the end of the time limit.




# ⚠️ Wait, don't code right away!!!!

As with any project, a good start is crucial to success.

You learned to code but you also learned to prepare. So, think before acting!

The first morning, until noon, but no more than that, perform the following tasks and present them:

* **write user stories (about 3 or 5)**
* **draw a wireframe (not too many pages)**
* **design the conceptual database model**

All of the items above should be accessible in the\_resources\_ folder in your repository
(take pictures or screenshots of your drawings).

For the wireframes and data models, you should try to do it on paper, unless you feel very comfortable with digital tools. Try not to waste time with an app or tool if you don't know how it works! You can always use a good old pen and a sheet of paper.

Before coding, discuss and validate your idea with your instructor.
If your instructor takes too much time to validate your primary work, because your colleagues took them hostage, you can start coding, but, keep in mind that your application could change after your instructor's review.

### Code, code and then code

Code the features, use git branches, test your code. You know the drill.

If you get stuck, \_once you have tried everything (Search engines, StackOverflow, your old quests and workshops) \_call your instructor to the rescue via slack.

### Requirements

* The site must be responsive
* Data is stored in a database
* Follow best practices (tests are a big plus)
* The project must be available on your personal Github account
* Do not forget your favourite acronyms: KISS, DRY, SOLID and RTFM!

# 💪 Challenge

#### The first morning

Work on the preparation part of your project.

* **Draw the wireframe**
* **Create the database model**
* **Write user stories**

**You must validate this work with your instructor during this morning session, then you can start to code.**

#### Make it available on GitHub

Create your own repository and make it available online.

> Don't forget, everything you put on GitHub can be something to show a recruiter during a job interview. So make it clean and clear!

At the end of the second day, you can post a link to your repository.

In the README.md file, you should explain how to install and run your application.

Your repository **must have** a resources folder with a picture of

* the wireframes,
* the MCD
* the product backlog.

#### Keep in mind

Do your best to give your users a wild experience!
